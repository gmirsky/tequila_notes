# Greg's Tequila Notes

## TL;DR
Anything from NOM (distillery) 1123, 1146, 1414, or 1579 is a good safe bet if you are trying to buy a tequila and you don't know much about tequila. Every tequila bottle will have a NOM number. It is usually on the back label.

## Definition of Tequila

Tequila can only be legally made in the following five states in Mexico: Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. The state of Jalisco, where the city of Tequila is located, produces the vast majority of the world's tequila.

## Tequila Types

Highlands tequila is known for being fruitier, sweeter, and more floral.  Soil is generally red clay. Some examples of highland tequila brands are: 
* Patrón
* Don Julio
* El Tesoro
* G4

Lowlands tequila is typically more rustic, with an earthier, spicier, and more herbaceous flavor. Soil is dark volcanic composition, called tierra negra, which has a high mineral content. Some examples of lowland brands are:
* Fortaleza
* Herradura
* Jose Cuervo
* Tequila Ocho

## Tequila Classifications

### Blanco/Silver

Blanco or Silver tequila is the classic expression of tequila. It is un-aged/un-rested.

### Joven

Joven (young) tequila can be one of two definitions:

* Can be a “mixto” often called Gold or “Oro”. Gold Tequila is often a mixto tequila that is an “Abocado”: a tequila that has not rested in wood but instead has had caramel color, oak extract, glycerin, and/or sugar syrup added to make it appear as though it has.
* Can be a blanco tequila that has been blended with other aged tequilas. These tequilas are 100% agave with a predominantly blanco flavor profile with aged tequila notes. Casa Dragones is an example of a 100% agave Joven Tequila made from blanco tequilas blended with 5 year extra añejo tequilas.

### Reposado

Reposado was introduced in 1968 and means 'rested' (aged 60+ days). A reposado tequila must be matured in oak or Holm oak casks of unspecified size or vats called 'pipones' (also of an unspecified size) for a
minimum of 60 days.

### Añejo

Añejo (AKA Extra Aged) tequila (aged 1+ years). Añejo (literally 'old') tequila, which may also be labelled 'extra aged', is tequila that has been aged in sealed oak or Holm oak casks with a maximum capacity of 600 liters for at least one year. Caramel may be added to adjust the color and additives added to enhance flavor.

### Extra Añejo

Extra Añejo (AKA Ultra Aged) tequila (aged 3+years). Extra Añejo (extra old) tequila, which may also be labelled 'ultra aged', is a comparatively new tequila category introduced in March 2006. The terms refer to tequila aged in sealed oak or Holm oak casks with a maximum capacity of 600 liters for a minimum of three years. 

### Rosa

Rosa  or pink is a young version of the tequila spirit that is "lightly aged in red wine barrels. The Real family is credited with the creation of the "rosa" category in the 1950s.

### Curados

Curados are tequilas flavored with natural ingredients such as lemon, orange, tangerine,
strawberry, pineapple and pear. You can also flavor tequila yourself in much the same way you
would infuse flavor in a bottle of vodka. This category was launched in 2006 only requires a minimum 25% agave spirit to be used, leaving the remaining 75% of the fermentable sugars added can comprise cane or corn sugars. The standard (NOM-006-SCFI-2005) allows the addition of sweeteners, coloring and or flavorings to curados in
quantities of up to 75ml per liter. 

### Cristalinos

Cristalinos are aged tequilas that have been charcoal filtered or redistilled to remove the amber
hue imparted by oak during maturation to leave a crystal-clear tequila. This category emerged in 2011 with Don Julio 70. Mostly applied to añejo tequilas, charcoal filtration is much more commonplace than redistillation and this usually entails adding activated carbon dust to the aged tequila and then passing the tequila through cellulose filter pads to strip out the charcoal, and along with it, the color. This process removes some of the desirable flavors and mouthfeel from the fatty acids. Vanillins and other stripped flavors may be reintroduced prior to bottling with additives, permitted by the CRT if not more than 1% of volume. Just think of this as rehabilitated tequila that has been over processed.

## Abbreviations

* CRT: Consejo Regulador Del Tequila, A.C.  (Tequila Regulatory Council), a non-profit organization that governs  the production and authenticity of tequila. It enforces the rules in Mexican distilleries to ensure that products labeled as tequila are made with blue agave from designated regions, the distilleries use specific production methods, and the products meet certain quality standards.
* NOM (Norma Oficial Mexicana), a number issued by the CRT to each tequila distillery. Every tequila bottle must list the NOM number on the bottle.

## General Notes

* Verification Challenges: The Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) allows up to 1% additives (e.g., caramel, glycerin, oak extract) without disclosure, making it hard to confirm additive-free status unless verified by programs like Tequila Matchmaker or through distillery transparency. (https://daily.sevenfifty.com/the-11-best-additive-free-tequilas-according-to-experts/) (https://uproxx.com/life/best-additive-free-tequila-under-50-ranked/)
* NOM 1480 (Tequila Las Americas) All 41 brands from this USDA Organic Certified distillery, like 123 Organic and Burgues Azteca, are marketed as additive-free. (https://spiritedagave.com/additive-free-tequila-list-brands/)
* Testing Tip: To check for additives, rub a small amount of tequila between your hands. If it dries without stickiness, it’s likely additive-free.(https://uproxx.com/life/best-additive-free-tequila-under-50-ranked/)
